## Natural Risks

To assess natural risks, we utilized a [Google Earth Engine script](https://code.earthengine.google.com/d2d854f03a2f7af5b43567c8e6a75360) which performs project-area-scale analyses on fire, soil erosion, etc.

### Fire

#### Rating:
Significance: Minor (5 percent to less than 25 percent loss of carbon stocks)
Historical Likelihood: More than once every 10 years

Historical Natural Risk Score (LS): 5
Mitigation (M): 0.5

#### Justification: 
GEE script output shows:
```
Average burned_percent over years:
14.221358955969876
```
Furthermore, efforts are actively being taken to mitigate this risk.

### Pest and Disease
#### Rating:
Significance: Minor (5 percent to less than 25 percent loss of carbon stocks)
Historical Likelihood: Once every 25 to less than 50 years

Historical Natural Risk Score (LS): 3
Mitigation (M): 0.5

#### Justification: 
Sources:
- Ministry of Agriculture pest outbreak data.  
- Household surveys.  
- Project biodiversity planting records (resistant species).

Furthermore, efforts are actively being taken to mitigate this risk.

### Extreme Weather
#### Rating:
Significance: Insignificant (less than 5 percent loss of carbon stocks) or transient (full recovery of lost carbon stocks expected within 10 years of any event)
Historical Likelihood: Once every 25 to less than 50 years

Historical Natural Risk Score (LS): 2
Mitigation (M): 0.5

#### Justification: 
Soil carbon is less prone to yearly fluxes in yearly temperature, rainfall, etc. and single extreme weather events, and is threatened more from changes in long-term management practices. A relevant peer-reviewed source supporting the idea that soil carbon is less influenced by short-term weather fluctuations (like annual temperature and rainfall variability or individual extreme events) and more affected by long-term changes in management comes from ["Management-induced changes in soil organic carbon on global croplands" published in _Biogeosciences_](https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5125-2022).

Furthermore, efforts are actively being taken to mitigate this risk.
